# algorithm-implementations

This repository contains a variety of statistical, machine learning, and optimization algorithms that were personally implemented by Sean Kent.  Style of data used may vary across algorithms, but they should generally showcase the ability to turn an algorithm into useable, clean code in either Python, R, or Matlab. 

Each algorithm exists in a separate folder, which should contain enough data and code to demonstrate the algorithm working.  Folders are independent of each other.
